# Demo file to show interacting with swarm by show status, creating a service,
# scaling it and then stopping service
#
# This script is intended to be used as part of the demo.
# It echos a command line as if it was being typed live and then executes the line.
# It then pauses and waits for a keypress before continuing.
#
# To do this magic, it requires the 'randtype' package to be installed:
#    sudu apt-get install randtype
