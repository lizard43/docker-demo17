# Raspberry Pi w/ Docker

We'll use several Raspberry Pi's as part of the swarm demo.

The Hypriot Docker Image for Raspberry Pi is one of the better option to get going on a Pi with the latest Docker version.

Download an image from the above link and write to your SD card using Hypriot's 'flash' utility which can be found here:

    https://github.com/hypriot/flash

Example:

    ./flash -n <host> -s <ssid> -p <password> hypriotos-rpi-v1.4.0-Docker-17.03.0-ce.img.zip


Start your Pi with the flashed SD card and enjoy instant Docker awesomeness.

The Hypriot image comes with one user with sudo privileges:

username: pirate

password: hypriot
