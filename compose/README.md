Docker Compose Demo 
====================

* [https://docs.docker.com/compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 

With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application’s services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.

1. Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
1. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
1. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.

A docker-compose.yml looks like this:

version: '2'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
    - .:/code
    - logvolume01:/var/log
    links:
    - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
